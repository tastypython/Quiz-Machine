Weekly Project 4

Write a MCQ General Knowledge Quiz of 15 questions, each having 4 options to choose and one correct answer
Each correct answer is 1 mark
Each Wrong answer is 0 mark

Print the final marks of the user and close the program gracefully.
You can make the text in colour if you wish to.
Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string — the grade for that mark — according to this scheme:

Mark
	

Grade


	

A if [>= 90
	

B if [70-90)
	

C if [60-70)
	

D if [0 to 60)

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and open interval excludes it. So 69.99999 gets grade C , but 70 gets grade B.
